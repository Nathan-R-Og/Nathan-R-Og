# I AM NATHAN R.

i do game stuff and coding sometimes usually hopefully

i can animate, music, develop and write (all that good stuff)

i also love absolutely ripping apart old crusty video games for developer trivia and modding purposes

## Stuff

### Chameleon Twist

i helped start (and maintain usually) [The Chameleon Twist Reverse Engineering Team](https://github.com/chameleonTwistRet), with aim to completely reverse engineer [Chameleon Twist 1 (JP)](https://github.com/chameleonTwistRet/chameleonTwistv1.0-JP)

other versions to follow obviously but jp just has more content

### Other Decompilations/Dissassemblies

here are a list of other, less known games ive started or want to start decomps/disasms for

* [Chavlo 55 - Super Puzzle Action](https://github.com/Nathan-R-Og/chalvo55) (Gameboy)

* [Donkey Kong Jr. Math](https://github.com/Nathan-R-Og/DKJRMath) (NES)

* [Mother / Earthbound Beginnings / Zero](https://github.com/Nathan-R-Og/mother) (NES)

* Kirby's Adventure (NES)

* Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love (NDS)

* Planet DOB (PSX)

* Gregory Horror Show (PS2)

* Pokemon Channel (GCN)

* Pac-Man Party (Wii)

(list subject to change)

mostly random hipster games i think would be cool to rip apart and or port to newer hardware

### My own stuff

i primarily use [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to create games (and even animations sometimes! youd be surprised), as its a fairly good starting software and just general engine for developers

i've open sourced (either out of obligation or just because i wanted to) many of my libraries ive used to create/am going to use to create games

you can find a majority [here](https://github.com/Nathan-R-Og/GodotOpenLibraries) or by looking up whatever repos i own that have a LOT of gdscript (subject to change)

also ive put all of my games' source code here, so expect those either after i die or 15 years after release (or you can just decompile them manually. who am i to judge)

## Contact

id prefer if you contacted me through [email](nathanielrobinson531@gmail.com), as that's my """""work""""" email

i have like 2 other emails for different purposes it just so happens this is the one i use for incredibly important sparce email stuff

and i know this email is gonna get scraped but that is a risk i am willing to take
